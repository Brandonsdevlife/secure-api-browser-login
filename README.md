# secure-api-browser-login
This project will create a secure login system that allows users to code linked to their brokerage accounts. The system will store user-specific code that can be executed to communicate with various brokerages via the API. The focus will be on ensuring secure access, safe storage of the code, and proper execution within a web-based environment.
